================================
Geant4 CeBr3 Gamma Detectors
================================

Build Instructions:

	1. Download Source

	2. Make Build Directory

	% cd path_to_folder_with_source		# go to directory which contains the source folder 
	% mkdir CeBr3Detector_build		# make empty directory for build
       	% cd exampleXYZ_build			# go to build directory

	3. Run CMake
	
       	% cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_Geant4_installation/build/ ../CeBr3Detector

	Note: The specific path passed to -DGeant4_DIR= will depend on how Geant4
		is installed. It should be the path to the directory containing 
		Geant4Config.cmake 

	4. Make Executable
	
	% make 					# make executable

Run Instructions:

	1. Run Executable
	
	% ./CeBr3Detector

	Note: An example of steps 2 and 3 is given in exampleRun.mac.
		exampleRun.mac can be run with "/control/execute exampleRun.mac"


	2. Set Source
	
	/gun/particle ion
	/gun/ion Z A				# Z = Proton Number
						# A = Atomic Number

	3. Run Simulation

	/run/beamOn N				# N is the number of nuclei that are simulated

	4. Exit Executable
	
	exit

	5. Generate Plots

	Open ROOT and run the macro GeneratePlots.C
	
	.x GeneratePlots.C			# Generates Root file Plots.root
						# Should return 0
	

	These plots can viewed with TBrowser.
